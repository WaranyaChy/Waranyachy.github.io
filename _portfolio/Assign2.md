This project uses Python to retrieve 7-day weather forecast data from the TMD WeatherForecast7Days API. The data are processed and visualized as plots and an interactive map of Thailand, with provinces colored by maximum temperature. A dynamic colorbar represents temperature ranges, and tooltips/popups display details such as forecast date, temperature, wind speed, and weather description for each province.
