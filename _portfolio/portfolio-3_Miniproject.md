This portfolio item presents an interactive Python tool developed to identify wells located within a user-defined polygon on a map.  
Users can draw a polygon directly on the map, and the tool automatically determines which wells and their associated attributes fall inside the selected area.

The tool uses mock well data containing well names, latitude–longitude coordinates, and log availability information.  
It also supports exporting selected wells to an Excel file and saving the resulting map image for documentation or further analysis.  
A **Clear** function is included to reset the polygon and allow new selections.
